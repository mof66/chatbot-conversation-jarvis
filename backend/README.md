### Create Environment Variables

Create your .env file

Update your .env file with the following. You can see your .env by typing sudo nano .env or just by clicking on the file if you are in VS Code.

Alternatively, you can ensure your server resets every time you make a change by typing:

```

You can check your server is working by going to:

```plain
http://localhost:8000/health
```
